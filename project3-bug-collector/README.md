# cis106-python-projects/project3-bug-collector
### Leomar Dur√°n

A project demonstrating repetition structures, namely
* a count-control loop to collect and process data about collecting
  bugs for 5 days,
* a nested loop
    * a condition-control loop
        * specifically, an input validation loop to check the data
          input, and
* calculating a running total of the bugs collected during a 5 day
  period.
